This study investigated the actual consumption of fitness supple-\\nments utilizing the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Health Belief Model (HBM), and the Theory\\nof Effort Minimization in Physical Activity (TEMPA) frameworks. The TPB provided insights into\\nhow attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control influence individuals’ intentions\\nto consume fitness supplements. Additionally, the HBM sheds light on perceived effectiveness,\\nbenefits, barriers, and health motivation related to supplement consumption. Integrating the TEMPA\\nframework further investigated the role of effort minimization in physical activity contexts. Through\\nan online questionnaire, data were collected from a sample of 250 fitness supplement-consuming\\nrespondents. SEM analysis revealed significant associations between behavioral intentions and\\nattitudes, perceived behavioral control, health motivation, and controlled precursors. However, it\\nwas seen that subjective norms, perceived effectiveness, perceived benefits, and automatic precursors\\nwere deemed insignificant. The findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the factors\\nshaping actual consumption behaviors, offering valuable implications for marketers, health profes-\\nsionals, and policymakers seeking to promote informed and responsible supplement use among\\nhealth and fitness enthusiasts.\\nKeywords: fitness supplements; health belief model; theory of effort of minimization; theory of\\nplanned behavior; structural equation modelling\\n1. Introduction\\nSupplementary drinks or fitness supplements are commonly used to enhance an\\nindividual’s performance in various sports and health settings, catering to both competitive\\nand non-competitive athletes [1]. One widely known supplement for athletes and fitness\\nenthusiasts is protein supplements like protein shakes. Others may be whey protein,\\ncaffeine, and creatine, to name a few. These supplements play a crucial role in helping\\nindividuals increase muscle mass, recover faster, and enhance their overall performance [2].\\nWhey protein stands out as a top-quality protein source, containing more essential amino\\nacids than traditional protein sources. Its numerous benefits have made it a popular choice\\nfor snacks and drinks among consumers [3]. Another widely embraced supplement is\\ncaffeine, which is found in many sports and food supplements. Caffeine reduces perceived\\neffort, minimizes fatigue and pain, and proves to be effective for endurance and high-\\nintensity activities, which is the choice of consumers [4].\\nCreatine monohydrate is another well-known supplement used to gain muscle mass\\nand support performance and recovery. It is known not to increase fat mass and remains\\neffective even when taken in recommended doses [5].

      "1. **Eat enough protein**: Protein is essential for building and repairing muscle tissue. Aim for 1.2-1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily.\n",
      "2. **Resistance training**: Focus on weightlifting exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once, such as squats, deadlifts, bench press, and rows.\n",
      "3. **Progressive overload**: Gradually increase the weight or resistance you're lifting over time to challenge your muscles and stimulate growth.\n",
      "4. **Rest and recovery**: Adequate rest and recovery are crucial for muscle growth. Ensure you're getting 7-9 hours of sleep per night and taking rest days as needed.\n",
      "5. **Caloric surplus**: Consume more calories than you burn, with a focus on carbohydrates and protein-rich foods to support muscle growth.\n",
      "6. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help your muscles recover and grow.\n",
      "7. **Consider supplements**: Supplements like protein powder, creatine, and HMB can help support muscle growth, but always consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian before adding new supplements to your routine.\n",

      "4. **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to help regulate hunger hormones and support weight loss.\n",
      "5. **Be mindful of portion sizes**: Pay attention to the serving sizes of your food and try to eat until you're satisfied, not stuffed.\n",

      "This article discusses the potential therapeutic and toxic mechanisms of action of botanical supplements, also known as herbal remedies. The authors review various botanicals, their primary active constituents, typical use, dosage, and reported adverse effects. They note that concurrent exposure to other compounds and the heterogeneity of herbal supplements can make it difficult to determine the specific mechanism of toxicity. Case reports have identified potential mechanisms for liver toxicity in some botanicals, such as black cohosh, kava kava, saw palmetto, and milk thistle. Other botanicals, such as yohimbe and ginkgo biloba, have been associated with non-hepatic symptoms like seizures and bleeding. The article also discusses potential herb-drug interactions, where the activation of metabolizing enzymes can affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs.\n",

      "Some key points from the article include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Botanical supplements can have therapeutic and toxic mechanisms of action.\n",
      "* Many botanicals have not been thoroughly studied for their safety and efficacy.\n",
      "* Adverse effects are often mild but can be serious in some cases, such as liver failure and bleeding.\n",
      "* Herb-drug interactions can occur due to the activation of metabolizing enzymes.\n",
      "* The pregnane-X receptor (PXR) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) are common mechanisms among several botanicals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the article highlights the need for further research on the safety and efficacy of botanical supplements and their potential interactions with other medications.\n"

The authors review various case reports and in vivo studies to highlight the mechanisms underlying these adverse effects, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and alteration of bile acid homeostasis. They also discuss herb-drug interactions, including induction or suppression of metabolizing enzymes, which can affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs. The article emphasizes the need for caution when using botanical supplements, particularly in combination with other compounds, and highlights the importance of monitoring patients for potential adverse effects.\n"
