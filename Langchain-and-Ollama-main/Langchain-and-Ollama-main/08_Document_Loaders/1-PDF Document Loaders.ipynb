This study investigated the actual consumption of fitness supple-\\nments utilizing the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Health Belief Model (HBM), and the Theory\\nof Effort Minimization in Physical Activity (TEMPA) frameworks. The TPB provided insights into\\nhow attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control influence individuals’ intentions\\nto consume fitness supplements. Additionally, the HBM sheds light on perceived effectiveness,\\nbenefits, barriers, and health motivation related to supplement consumption. Integrating the TEMPA\\nframework further investigated the role of effort minimization in physical activity contexts. Through\\nan online questionnaire, data were collected from a sample of 250 fitness supplement-consuming\\nrespondents. SEM analysis revealed significant associations between behavioral intentions and\\nattitudes, perceived behavioral control, health motivation, and controlled precursors. However, it\\nwas seen that subjective norms, perceived effectiveness, perceived benefits, and automatic precursors\\nwere deemed insignificant. The findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the factors\\nshaping actual consumption behaviors, offering valuable implications for marketers, health profes-\\nsionals, and policymakers seeking to promote informed and responsible supplement use among\\nhealth and fitness enthusiasts.\\nKeywords: fitness supplements; health belief model; theory of effort of minimization; theory of\\nplanned behavior; structural equation modelling\\n1. Introduction\\nSupplementary drinks or fitness supplements are commonly used to enhance an\\nindividual’s performance in various sports and health settings, catering to both competitive\\nand non-competitive athletes [1]. One widely known supplement for athletes and fitness\\nenthusiasts is protein supplements like protein shakes. Others may be whey protein,\\ncaffeine, and creatine, to name a few. These supplements play a crucial role in helping\\nindividuals increase muscle mass, recover faster, and enhance their overall performance [2].\\nWhey protein stands out as a top-quality protein source, containing more essential amino\\nacids than traditional protein sources. Its numerous benefits have made it a popular choice\\nfor snacks and drinks among consumers [3]. Another widely embraced supplement is\\ncaffeine, which is found in many sports and food supplements. Caffeine reduces perceived\\neffort, minimizes fatigue and pain, and proves to be effective for endurance and high-\\nintensity activities, which is the choice of consumers [4].\\nCreatine monohydrate is another well-known supplement used to gain muscle mass\\nand support performance and recovery. It is known not to increase fat mass and remains\\neffective even when taken in recommended doses [5].

      "This article discusses the potential health risks associated with the use of botanicals, which are herbal remedies derived from plants. The authors review various studies and case reports to highlight the possible toxicities and interactions of botanicals with other medications.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key points:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Botanicals can cause liver damage and induce drug-metabolizing enzymes, leading to potential herb-drug interactions.\n",
      "2. Case reports have linked certain botanicals to severe health problems, such as liver failure, seizures, bleeding disorders, and cardiovascular events.\n",
      "3. The mechanisms underlying the toxic effects of botanicals are often complex and involve multiple pathways, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and alteration of bile acid homeostasis.\n",
      "4. Some botanicals, such as black cohosh and ginkgo biloba, have been implicated in causing excessive bleeding due to their ability to inhibit platelet aggregation.\n",
      "5. Herb-drug interactions are a significant concern, particularly for medications that are metabolized by the same enzymes as botanicals.\n",
      "6. The authors highlight the need for further research on the safety profiles of various botanicals and the development of guidelines for their safe use.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Botanicals discussed in the article:**\n",

      "\n",
      "**Key takeaways:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Botanicals can pose significant health risks, particularly for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions or those taking certain medications.\n",
      "2. More research is needed to fully understand the safety profiles of various botanicals and their potential interactions with other medications.\n",
      "3. Healthcare providers should be aware of the potential risks associated with botanical use and advise patients accordingly.\n",
      "4. Patients should consult with healthcare providers before using any botanical remedy, especially if they have a history of medical conditions or are taking prescription medications.\n"

      "This article reviews the potential toxicities and interactions of various botanical supplements, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa): associated with jaundice and liver failure in menopausal women, possibly due to oxidative stress.\n",
      "2. Kava kava: linked to liver toxicity, potentially caused by depletion of glutathione and inhibition of cyclooxygenases.\n",
      "3. Saw palmetto: associated with cholestatic hepatitis and pancreatitis.\n",
      "4. Echinacea: may cause acute liver failure without a clear mechanism.\n",
      "5. Valerian: can induce jaundice that reverses with steroid administration.\n",
      "6. Yohimbine: can cause seizures, tachycardia, and hypertension due to its sympathomimetic properties.\n",
      "7. Milk thistle: may exacerbate hemochromatosis in individuals predisposed to iron overload.\n",
      "8. Ginseng: implicated in a transient ischemic attack without a clear mechanism.\n",
      "9. Black cohosh: regulates heart rate via activation of serotonin receptors, possibly causing bradycardia.\n",
      "10. Garlic and ginkgo biloba: both associated with excessive bleeding due to their antiplatelet aggregating properties.\n",

      "1. Induction or suppression of metabolizing enzymes, which can affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs and warrant contraindications.\n",

      "**Detailed Report on Adverse Effects of Botanical Supplements**\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of botanical supplements has been associated with various adverse effects, ranging from mild to severe. The following is a summary of reported cases and potential mechanisms:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Hepatotoxicity**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa)**: Associated with jaundice and liver failure in menopausal women, with pathological oxidative stress observed.\n",
      "*   **Kava kava**: Liver toxicity, sometimes requiring transplants, attributed to depletion of glutathione and inhibition of cyclooxygenases.\n",
      "*   **Saw palmetto**: Cholestatic hepatitis, with alterations in bile secretion linked to pancreatitis.\n",
      "*   **Echinacea**: Acute liver failure, without a specific mechanism hypothesized.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Non-hepatic Symptoms**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Yohimbe**: Seizure with tachycardia and hypertension in a bodybuilder.\n",
      "*   **Milk thistle**: Exacerbated hemochromatosis (iron overload) in a genetically predisposed individual, which resolved upon cessation of supplement use.\n",
      "*   **Ginseng**: Transient ischemia attack in a 64-year-old man.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cardiovascular Outcomes**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Black cohosh**: \"Probably responsible\" for observed bradycardia in a 59-year-old woman, potentially via activation of serotonin receptors.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bleeding Risks**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Garlic**: Excessive bleeding in a 71-year-old man prior to surgery.\n",
      "*   **Ginkgo biloba**: Spontaneous bleeding in men and women, attributed to gingkolide B's inhibition of platelet aggregating factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Herb-Drug Interactions**\n",
      "\n",
      "Potential herb-drug interactions are more extensively understood than adverse effects. Pharmacologically active compounds in botanicals can induce or suppress metabolizing enzymes, affecting the pharmacokinetics of drugs and warranting contraindications by healthcare providers. The activation of pregnane-X receptor (PXR) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) has been implicated as common mechanisms among several botanicals.\n",
      "\n",
      "These findings highlight the importance of careful consideration and monitoring when using botanical supplements, particularly in individuals with pre-existing medical conditions or taking medications.\n"
